# Fetch effects data
This repository contains the dataset of plots of the paper titled "Fetch effects on air-sea momentum transfer at very high wind speeds" published in the Coastal Engineering Journal (Taylor and Francis). The paper, authored by Naohisa Takagaki, Naoya Suzuki, Koji Iwano, Kazuki Nishiumi, Ryota Hayashi, Naoki Kurihara, Kosuke Nishitani, and Takumi Hamaguchi, estimates the air-sea momentum flux under the long-fetch condition (20 m fetch) at very high wind speeds.

The air-water momentum flux was measured in a typhoon simulation tank at the Research Institute of Applied Mechanics, Kyushu University, Japan. The verification was performed using previous values estimated by the eddy correlation method in a typhoon simulation tank at Kyoto University, Japan.
